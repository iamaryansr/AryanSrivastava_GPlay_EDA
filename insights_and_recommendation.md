Key Insights
- Ratings are mostly between 4.0–4.5, indicating general satisfaction.
- Free apps dominate the store (~90%).
- Communication, Tools, and Entertainment categories have the highest counts.
- Higher installs do not always mean higher ratings; some top installed apps have mediocre ratings.
- Paid apps are rare and not necessarily higher rated than free apps.
- Categories like Education and Health have strong average ratings but fewer installs → opportunity areas.
- Large missingness in `Size` column; "Varies with device" reduces data quality.

 Recommendations
1. Focus on **Education & Health** categories for new app development (high ratings, underserved).
2. Paid pricing should remain low/moderate → no strong correlation with higher ratings.
3. Improve **user engagement (reviews)**, as more reviews tend to align with better ratings.
4. Apps with large size missingness should be checked (device compatibility issues).
5. Marketing strategies should emphasize **free apps with in-app purchases** over paid upfront.
